As per US Self Regulatory Agencies certain activities must be reviewed by ‘Registered Supervisors’ of the business divisions for Regulated Entities. This review of activities is called Supervision. The function of supervision is driven by WSPs based on regulatory guidelines that Compliance governs. These WSPs define the tasks each supervisor needs to attest to.
